## Hey there, I'm Adam!

![face](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1589887)

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Adam Dougal**, a software engineer currently crafting solutions at 
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>. This blog is my digital playground where I 
share my insights on best working practices, step-by-step guides, and the intriguing aspects of software engineering 
that keep me hooked.

My software engineering journey began shortly after university, joining 
<a href="https://www.sky.com/" target="_blank">Sky</a> on their Software Academy graduate scheme. I spent most of my 
time there working on Java-based backend systems that power services like 
<a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/sky-go/" target="_blank">Sky Go</a>, 
<a href="https://www.nowtv.com/" target="_blank">Now TV</a>,
and <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/" target="_blank"> NBCU Peacock</a> to millions of customers. As I grew in my 
role, I shifted my focus to the Internal Developer Platform, simplifying the process for developers to deploy their 
services to Kubernetes.

Recently, I've embarked on a new adventure with Microsoft, specifically with the 
<a href="https://playbook.microsoft.com/code-with-engineering/ISE/" target="_blank">ISE team</a>. Here, I work closely 
with Microsoft's customers, using cutting-edge technologies like Azure and AI to solve their problems.

I'm a staunch advocate of engineering principles like pair programming, which I believe is a cornerstone of
collaborative and quality code. I have a passion for crafting seamless CI/CD pipelines, testing the untestable, and
exploring the boundless opportunities within Azure and AI. I'm excited to share my journey with you!

When I'm not decoding the latest tech trends, you can find me immersed in the adrenaline-fueled world of Formula
One, strategizing over board games, or unwinding with my favorite films and TV shows.
