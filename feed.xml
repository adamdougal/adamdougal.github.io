<p>Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>Iâ€™m <strong>Adam Dougal</strong>, a software engineer currently crafting solutions at 
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>. This blog is my digital playground where I 
share my insights on best working practices, step-by-step guides, and the intriguing aspects of software engineering 
that keep me hooked.</p>

<p>My software engineering journey began shortly after university, joining 
<a href="https://www.sky.com/" target="_blank">Sky</a> on their Software Academy graduate scheme. I spent most of my 
time there working on Java-based backend systems that power services like 
<a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/sky-go/" target="_blank">Sky Go</a>, 
<a href="https://www.nowtv.com/" target="_blank">Now TV</a>,
and <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/" target="_blank"> NBCU Peacock</a> to millions of customers. As I grew in my 
role, I shifted my focus to the Internal Developer Platform, simplifying the process for developers to deploy their 
services to Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Recently, Iâ€™ve embarked on a new adventure with Microsoft, specifically with the 
<a href="https://playbook.microsoft.com/code-with-engineering/ISE/" target="_blank">ISE team</a>. Here, I work closely 
with Microsoftâ€™s customers, using cutting-edge technologies like Azure and AI to solve their problems.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a staunch advocate of engineering principles like pair programming, which I believe is a cornerstone of
collaborative and quality code. I have a passion for crafting seamless CI/CD pipelines, testing the untestable, and
exploring the boundless opportunities within Azure and AI. Iâ€™m excited to share my journey with you!</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not decoding the latest tech trends, you can find me immersed in the adrenaline-fueled world of Formula
One, strategizing over board games, or unwinding with my favorite films and TV shows.</p>
